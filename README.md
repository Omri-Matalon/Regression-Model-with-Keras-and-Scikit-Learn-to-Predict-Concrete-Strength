# Regression-Model-with-Keras-and-Scikit-Learn-to-Predict-Concrete-Strength

In this project a dataset of the compressive strength of different samples of concrete will be explored, and concrete strength will be prdicted based on the volumes of different ingredients used for preperation. Ingredients include:

1. Cement
2. Blast Furnace Slag
3. Fly Ash
4. Water
5. Superplasticizer
6. Coarse Aggregate
7. Fine Aggregate

A simple Artificial neural networks (ANN) regression model will be built and used for predicting concrete compressive strength based on volumes of said ingredients.
Thereafter, predictions will also be conducted using Scikit-learn Multi-Linear Regression model, and accuracy results will be compare to those of the ANN model.
